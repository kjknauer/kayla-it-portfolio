# Troubleshooting: Custom screensavers not showing in Windows

**Problem:**  
Downloaded custom screensavers were not appearing in the Windows screensaver selection menu.

**Steps I Took:**
- Researched how Windows handles screensaver files and learned it uses `.scr` files.
- Searched the system for existing `.scr` files to find the correct system directory.
- Identified the folder where Windows looks for screensavers.
- Moved the downloaded screensaver files into the correct system folder.

**Result:**  
The custom screensavers appeared in the Windows screensaver list and could be selected and used normally.

**Skills demonstrated:**  
- Windows OS navigation  
- File system and system folder understanding  
- Research and problem-solving  
- Attention to detail
